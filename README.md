# Qwen-32B Preview with Vision Capabilities

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Qwen-32B model with added vision capabilities. The project demonstrates the integration of multimodal features into the powerful Qwen language model, enabling it to process and understand both text and visual inputs.

## Features
- Multimodal processing capabilities (text + vision)
- Based on the Qwen-32B language model
- Support for image understanding and description
- Integration with various vision-related tasks
- Optimized performance and resource utilization

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA compatible GPU (recommended)
- Required packages (specified in requirements.txt)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vicmuchina/qwen-32b-preview-with-vision-capabilities.git
cd qwen-32b-preview-with-vision-capabilities
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
[Include specific usage instructions and examples]

## Model Architecture
The model builds upon the Qwen-32B architecture, incorporating vision transformers and multimodal attention mechanisms to process both text and image inputs effectively.
